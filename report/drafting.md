# Feature Findings

Idea: Do a table exploration and just count trues/falses for certain columns

It will be neat to gain some insights and to find related work/corroborating studies and articles

Goal is not to show any conclusions, but to show that our methods can be used for analysis in the field of studying language shifts!

## 2016 Only Notes

Via Katie:

```
in analysis:
a comparison of langShift== true/langShift==False and ages of respondents [ theory: more young respondents in our data, leaving less time for language shift to occur, leaving imbalance in data towards languageShift == False]
a comparison of genstat and langShift [ theory: more genstat ==1 (ie. first gen immigrants) in sample, means more langshift == false]
```

Analyze generation status and age of immigration and age in general

Language shift correlates with many fields which correlate with wealth!
* E.g. Highest_Education_Location_vs_Residence

Immigration status and Aboriginal status matter little, but immigrant generation, group, Aboriginal group, etc. matter much more; this may be due to the dropping of certain fields, which was done in the plain 2016 but not the comparisons

Mother's place of birth matters much more than father's

## Over Time Comparison Notes

Canadian citizenship status matters much more in 1991

Property value matter much more in 2016

Highest degree and secondary degree matters more in 2016, while highest attended matters more in 1991

Field of study matters much more in 2016
