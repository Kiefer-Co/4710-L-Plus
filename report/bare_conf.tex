% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Canada is a nation composed of a highly diverse language population. Immigration and migration has risen both in numbers and as culturally relevant components of modern communities, especially in diverse countries such as Canada.

This provides a unique opportunity to study the rates at which certain languages and language families are lost over subsequent generations as allophones (people with a mother tongue other than English or French) adopt English or French as their primary language. Certain factors such as sex, age, educational status and economic success may prove to be a key indicator of how quickly an individual adopts a language other than their mother tongue in everyday life.

A language shift occurs when an allophone adopts an official language as their primary language and ceases to use their mother tongue. Several studies have aimed to measure language shift rates through linear regression on various cohorts of the population. Ultimately, it is impossible to ascertain precisely when a language shift occurs, so the insights offered by linear regression are limited in accuracy.

This paper proposes an application of various data mining algorithms and compares their accuracy and speed when used on census data, namely the Random Forest algorithm, the Decision Tree algorithm, and the Gaussian Naive Bayesian algorithm.

Some challenges working with census microdata include the fact that the Public Use Microdata Files (PUMF) have been downsampled from the census population size. In order to perform an analysis that would take into account the population distribution, we needed to multiply records by a corresponding weight included in the PUMF datasets. Additionally, the PUMF datasets contain over 100 potential features, some of which contain largely invalid/unavailable data. As a result, some level of feature selection is required.

The Canadian census is conducted every five years. As a result, changes that occur between census periods may not be captured at the exact time of their occurrence.

\section{Related Work}
Over the past several years, researchers have come up with multiple approaches to analyze census microdata to determine the rates at which allophones express a language shift. Several authors has focused on identifying whether a  shift towards official languages (English and French) have occurred by determining if the mother tongue is the same as the language spoken at home. This is typically accomplished by performing linear regression.

\subsection{Linear Regression of Language Cohorts}
\subsubsection{Fictitious Cohorts}
Patrick Sabourin and Alain Bélanger use the concept of a 'fictitious cohort', in which groups separated by age or time since immigration are compared across a single census. They define language persistence as the proportion of each cohort that has kept their mother tongue as the language most often spoken at home. The authors analyze language shift using linear regression and polynomial regression. They then construct a survival curve which determines the probability that each subsection of a cohort (such as a specific age group) will undergo a language shift. They make the assumption that the rate of language shift is constant among several censuses.
\cite{dynamics1}

One limitation to this method is that members of a cohort are defined in binary terms as having lost a language if they no longer speak it at home, while this process might occur gradually in real time. Additionally, certain language groups may experience different rates of language shift. \cite{dynamics1}

\subsubsection{Synthetic Cohorts}
Marie T Mora, Daniel J Villa and Alberto Davila use an alternative method known as 'synthetic cohort' analysis on census data in the United States. Their paper aims to better understand the recent dynamic of language loss and intergenerational maintenance of Spanish in the U.S., and compare this understanding to other non-English languages. In other words, exploring the retention or loss of Spanish in the U.S., particularly among foreign-born and U.S.-born children with immigrant parents. \cite{spanish1}

The technique for analysis, synthetic cohort analysis, is based on data drawn from 1980, 1990, and 2000 United States Censuses. It creates a temporal representation of a population, over ten-year intervals. The authors track the reported language use of individuals starting at ages 5-7 and ending at ages 15-17 across two United States census. \cite{spanish1}

This is in contrast to cross-sectional methods like the synthetic cohort method which uses data from only one Census period to analyze language shifts. Combining this method with the synthetic cohort, the paper argues that the dynamic in language shift is better predicted, as supported by what has been observed in the U.S. \cite{spanish1}

There are still some difficulties with this approach. For example, 1980 and 1990 samples could have emigrations before 1990 and 2000, and from this the “true” cohorts of the foreign-born may not be entirely reflected.\cite{spanish1}

\subsubsection{Limitations of Linear Regression}
As seen above, multiple approaches to analyzing language cohorts temporally run into limitations in how census data is collected. Sampling errors and poorly worded census questions make it difficult to capture whether emigration has occurred between censuses. Even within a census, it is tempting to view language shift within a cohort as binary when this process occurs gradually.

Populations are dynamic, and multiple categorical variables influence whether a language that is the mother tongue is spoken at home. A decision tree can reveal which categorical variables determine whether mother tongue is retained as the language spoken at home. Conversely, linear regression is poorly suited for finding insights from categorical data.

\subsection{Decision Tree Performance in Other Areas}
% @TODO think of a better name for the subsub-section
\subsubsection{Decision Trees in Student Performance Prediction}
% @TODO transition better into this
Decision trees have also been compared and applied in other fields. Osmanbegovic and Suljic compared the performance of an implementation of a decision tree algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm, and a Multilayer Perceptron algorithm in predicting student performance by the prediction accuracy, learning time, and error rate. \cite{performance1}

Osmanbegovic and Suljic used 12 input features such as gender, GPA, and whether or not the student had scholarships, and outputted whether or not the student would pass or fail. The output could also be classified by letter grades, but due to the disparity in the amount of data for each class, was not used. \cite{performance1}

They found that the Naive Bayes algorithm managed to outperform the C4.5 decision tree algorithm implementation, J48, in both prediction accuracy, and error rate. Additionally, it was found that the Naive Bayes algorithm and the decision tree algorithm created prediction models that were both accurate, and user-friendly enough for the stakeholders. \cite{performance1}

% @TODO think of a better name for this
\subsubsection{Improvements}
Similarly to Osmanbegovic and Suljic's data, some classes in census data are going to have differing amounts of data, and will affect prediction accuracy. Instead of changing the class groupings to get more equal representation, weights could be added to the training data to account for these differences. In the case of the Canadian Census data, these weights are already added to the data for use.

% @TODO take another pass at this paper - it keeps going over my head
\subsection{An Alternative Approach to Census Data Mining}
In their paper, Klösgen and May took a different approach to mining census data. Klösgen and May used the United Kingdom's census data, which was only available in an aggregated form. The census data was available aggregated across various wards within the region, along with a detailed set of geographic layers. Thus, Klösgen and May decided to use those wards as the focus of their examination, and propose an application of SubgroupMiner, an advanced subgroup mining system. \cite{census1}

% @TODO title
\subsection{An Improved Decision Tree Algorithm}
Hulten, Spencer, and Domingos' CVFDT algorithm improves on the VFDT decision tree learner by accounting for data changing over time. \cite{dtrees1} Their CVFDT algorithm works by maintaining a decision tree with respect to a sliding window of data and grows an alternative subtree to replace an old one if it becomes out of date. This allows for it to learn a similar model to one from the VFDT algorithm but in constant time \cite{dtrees1}.

Applying the algorithm to census data seems like a natural fit, and can be used to improve the performance of any decision tree learners in use. The addition of the time aspect could also be used to improve the accuracy in cases where the data from only one period of time is used, instead of multiple.


\section{Main Body}

\subsection{Data Collection}
Data was collected from the 2016 Canadian census public use microdata file (PUMF), which contains around 930,421 (or ~2.7\% of the target population) individual, anonymized records, with 123 features. Additionally, there's an individual weight attached to each record, and 16 estimate weights for sampling variability.

\subsubsection{Privacy}
While the PUMF does give individual records, some of the data was aggregated to preserve confidentiality (e.g. categories being combined together), and some records had some of their variables changed to 'Not Available' for similar reasons. Furthermore, only the largest of the census metropolitan areas and provinces were covered. 

\subsubsection{Data Weighting and Sample Universe}
Since the PUMF data is only a sample of the target population, each record includes an individual weight to indicate how much of the target population that the record represents. In addition to the weights, 31 of the features are drawn from the universe of family, household, and dwelling universes, and the remaining 92 features are from the individual universe.

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning}
Since some values in the PUMF data are marked as invalid or unavailable, some preprocessing on the data is required. Due to each record having an individual weight attached to it, rather than impute a value for the missing/invalid values, those rows were dropped instead. 

In general, some features had a high rate of invalid data and were not used for any of the classifiers.
% @TODO more specifics on what was dropped

\subsection{Methodology}

Our analysis is performed in Python via Jupyter Notebooks.  Packages utilized include \textbf{pandas} for data manipulation, \textbf{scikit-learn} for implementations of the classification algorithms in question, and \textbf{bokeh} and \textbf{tabulate} for visualization and formatting of our data.

\subsubsection{Data Wrangling}
Prior to the execution of any classifiers, the PUMF dataset is passed through a single data preprocessing pipeline.  This pipeline achieves two broad objectives, namely pruning uninteresting data and selecting against features containing a high proportion of invalid data.

The feature selection process performed was a mix of manually intuited choices and insights from initial analysis using scikit-learn's decision tree classifier on unprocessed data.  Features which were pruned were both uninformative with regards to our goal of detecting home language shifts and possessed clearly understood reasons for their behaviour.  For example, MTNEN (mother tongue being English) was extremely negatively correlated with our shift metric, as English is the most spoken language in Canada and an unlikely home language to shift away from.  Conversely, LWAEN (language at work being English) and LWAFR (language at work being French), had little to no influence on our shift metric, which was understood to be the consequence of work language rarely being a language other than English or French.  Such features were pruned omitted from the preprocessed version of our dataset.

The PUMF dataset also contained missing, invalid, or inapplicable values as specified by certain numeric codes (e.g.  88888888) as specified in its accompanying Study Documentation.  Our initial preprocessing involved detecting the number of such values in each feature column as a proportion of the total number of entries.  Features which possessed an unususable percentage greater than 20 were pruned so as to not obscure our analysis by training classifiers on presence of a data feature rather than its content.

Our initial data anaylsis also found promising improvements when dropping rows featuring English as a mother tongue.  Removal of these rows lowered the unusable proportion of many features we intuited would provide useful insight, such as AGEIMM (age of immigration) which dropped from 88 to 61 percent unusable.  Although AGEIMM in particular remained unsuitable for our analysis as only a fraction of respondents provded a usable value, we opted to remove English mother tongue rows from our dataset with the intention of providing more focused analysis on changes within Canada's non-official language communities, from which shifts to English as a home language were more common than the inverse.

As mentioned, data imputation was considered as a remedy for unsusable data, but opted against due to the structure of the PUMF dataset.  The dataset is meant to balance presenting a representative subset of Canada's demographics while also anonymzing census results which, by Canadian law, are to be withheld from complete public disclosure for 92 years post-response.  As such, each row in the PUMF dataset is a weighted representation of several individuals.  Imputation of unusable values, even with the feature's weighted mean as a substitution, was reasoned to be unapplicable wiithout rendering the dataset no longer representative of Canada's demographics.

\subsubsection{Shift Detection}
Our process for identifying language shift involves constructing a Boolean feature we call \textbf{languageShift}, computed from the MTNNO (mother tongue) and HLANO (home language) attributes.

In the PUMF dataset, both the MTNNO and HLANO features are categorical attributes encoded as a numeric value.  Each feature's encodings are independent and cannot be readily compared, although there exists an intersection between the categories represented within each feature.  Dictionaries for mapping MTNNO and HLANO categories to equivalency classes were manually defined using information outlined in the PUMF Study Documentation file.  These classes include both whole languages such as "Arabic" as well as grouped categories such as "Austro-Asiatic languages".

As the MTNNO categories are less broad and appear to be a superset of the HLANO categories, some categories appear in MTNNO but not HLANO, such as "Uralic" or Korean".  Rather than omitting rows containing these mother tongues, we opted to categorize them under the "All other languages" class.

The value of our languageShift attribute is then defined as the presence of inequivalent class mappings in the MTNNO and HLANO features within a data row.  The reasoning behind this decision is that a difference between mother tongue and home language implies a shift having occurred at some point within an individual's lifetime, with the assumption made being that an individual's mother tongue must at one point have been their home language, possibly only in childhood or even outside of Canada.

If MTNNO can be mapped to HLANO, the languageShift value of a row is false.  If no mapping can be found, the languageShift value will be true.  As with other features in the dataset, the results of the languageShift column are to be interpreted as representative of several individuals.  A row's weight is to be factored into any analysis on or prediction of the languageShift feature.

\section{Analytic Evaluation}


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
